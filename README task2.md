# Task 2 : Implement a Machine Learning Model for Regression Problem
This repository contains code and documentation for a regression project focused on predicting PM2.5 air pollution levels. 
The project aims to build and evaluate regression models to predict PM2.5 
concentrations based on various features related to weather conditions and other factors.
